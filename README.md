## Introduction

**ckeletin-go** is a Golang scaffold project designed to help developers create professional, robust, and beautiful CLI applications. Inspired by the idea of a "skeleton," **ckeletin** provides a strong foundation on which you can build your own tooling, utilities, and interactive experiences.

This scaffold integrates essential libraries and tools that follow best practices:

- [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) for building flexible, modular CLI commands.
- [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) for configuration management via files, environment variables, and flags.
- [Zerolog](https://github.com/rs/zerolog) for structured, leveled logging.
- [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) for beautiful, interactive terminal UIs.
- Task automation with [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) and pre-commit hooks with [Lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook).
- High test coverage, code quality checks, and CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions and CodeQL.

Each command manages its own configuration and defaults, promoting modularity and ease of maintenance.

---

## Key Highlights

- **Single-Source Binary Name**: Update `BINARY_NAME` in `Taskfile.yml`, and `ldflags` handles the rest. No more hunting down references.
- **Detailed Coverage Reports**: Use `task test:coverage:text` to see exactly what code paths need testing.
- **Seamless Customization**: Easily add new commands, reconfigure settings, or integrate Bubble Tea UIs.

---

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/peiman/ckeletin-go.git
   cd ckeletin-go
   ```

2. **Set up development tools**:

   ```bash
   task setup
   ```

   Installs necessary tools and pre-commit hooks.

3. **Build and run the sample command**:

   ```bash
   task build
   ./ckeletin-go ping
   ```

   You'll see "Pong" printedâ€”congratulations, you're running the scaffold!

---

## Features

- **Modular Command Structure**: Add, remove, or update commands without breaking the rest of the application.
- **Structured Logging**: Use Zerolog to create efficient, leveled logs. Perfect for debugging, auditing, and production use.
- **Bubble Tea UI**: Optional, interactive UI for advanced terminal applications.
- **Single-Source Configuration**: Set defaults in config files, override with env vars, and fine-tune with flags.
- **Task Automation**: One Taskfile to define all build, test, and lint tasks.
- **High Test Coverage & Quality Checks**: Ensure a robust codebase that meets production standards.

---

## Architecture

This project follows well-documented architectural patterns captured in **[Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)](docs/adr/)**. These ADRs document key design decisions including ultra-thin commands, centralized configuration, dependency injection, structured logging, and the task-based development workflow.

See **[docs/adr/](docs/adr/)** for the complete list and detailed rationale.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Go**: Version specified in `go.mod` (currently maintained at the latest stable release).
- **Task**: Install from [taskfile.dev](https://taskfile.dev/#/installation).
- **Git**: For version control.

### Installation

#### Option 1: Download Pre-built Binary

Download the latest release for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/peiman/ckeletin-go/releases).

```bash
# Example for Linux amd64
curl -L https://github.com/peiman/ckeletin-go/releases/latest/download/ckeletin-go_linux_amd64.tar.gz | tar xz
sudo mv ckeletin-go /usr/local/bin/
```

#### Option 2: Homebrew (macOS/Linux) - If Enabled

If the maintainer has configured a Homebrew tap:

```bash
brew install peiman/tap/ckeletin-go
```

**Note**: Homebrew tap is optional and must be explicitly enabled by the project maintainer.

#### Option 3: Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/peiman/ckeletin-go.git
cd ckeletin-go
task setup
task build
```

### Using the Scaffold

1. Update `module` path in `go.mod`.
2. Change `BINARY_NAME` in `Taskfile.yml` to rename your CLI (e.g., `myapp`).
3. Build and run to confirm setup:

   ```bash
   task build
   ./myapp ping
   ```

### Important: Single Source of Truth for Names

This project uses a "single source of truth" approach for configuration:

1. **Binary Name**: Defined only in `Taskfile.yml` as `BINARY_NAME`. This is propagated through the codebase via build flags and the `binaryName` variable in `cmd/root.go`.

2. **Module Path**: Defined only in `go.mod` and referenced in `Taskfile.yml` as `MODULE_PATH`.

When customizing this project:

- Change `BINARY_NAME` in `Taskfile.yml` to your desired binary name
- Change the module path in `go.mod` to your own repository path
- Run `task build` to apply these changes throughout the codebase

This design ensures you don't need to search and replace names across multiple files.

### Customizing the Module Path

When you clone this repository, it's important to update the `MODULE_PATH` in the `go.mod` file to reflect your own repository path. This ensures that your module is uniquely identifiable and avoids conflicts with other projects.

#### Steps to Update the Module Path

1. **Open `go.mod`**: Locate the `go.mod` file in the root of the project.

2. **Edit the Module Path**: Change the module path to reflect your own repository. For example, if you're using GitHub, it might look like this:

   ```go
   module github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name
   ```

   If you're using another version control system, adjust the path accordingly. For example:

   ```go
   module gitlab.com/yourusername/your-repo-name
   ```

3. **Update References**: If the `MODULE_PATH` is used elsewhere in the project (e.g., in `Taskfile.yml` for build flags), update those references to match your new module path.

4. **Run `go mod tidy`**: After making changes, run `go mod tidy` to clean up any unnecessary dependencies and ensure the `go.mod` and `go.sum` files are up to date.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your version of the project is correctly configured and ready for further development or deployment.

---

## Configuration

**ckeletin-go** uses Viper for flexible configuration and also implements a centralized configuration system with a single source of truth:

### Configuration Management

All configuration options are organized in a modular structure:

- `internal/config/options.go`: Core `ConfigOption` type definition and methods
- `internal/config/core_options.go`: Application-wide settings that affect all commands
- Command options are co-located with their command files (e.g., `cmd/ping.go`, `cmd/docs.go`) and self-register into the configuration registry
- `internal/config/registry.go`: Aggregates all options into a single registry

Benefits of this modular approach:

- Clean separation between command-specific and application-wide settings
- Better maintainability as each command's options are isolated
- Simple extension by adding new command option files
- All options still accessible through a single registry
- Self-documenting configuration
- Improved testability with 100% test coverage

### Adding New Configuration Options

When adding a new configuration option for an existing command, add it to the appropriate file:

```go
// For ping command options, add to internal/config/ping_options.go
func PingOptions() []ConfigOption {
    return []ConfigOption{
        // Existing options...
        {
            Key:          "app.ping.new_setting",
            DefaultValue: "default-value",
            Description:  "Description of what this setting does",
            Type:         "string", 
            Required:     false,
            Example:      "example-value",
        },
    }
}
```

For a new command, create a new file following the naming pattern `<command>_options.go`:

```go
// internal/config/mycommand_options.go
package config

func MyCommandOptions() []ConfigOption {
    return []ConfigOption{
        {
            Key:          "app.mycommand.setting",
            DefaultValue: "default-value",
            Description:  "Description of what this setting does",
            Type:         "string",
            Required:     false,
            Example:      "example-value",
        },
    }
}
```

Then add it to the registry in `registry.go`:

```go
// in internal/config/registry.go
func Registry() []ConfigOption {
    // Start with application-wide core options
    options := CoreOptions()

    // Append command-specific options
    options = append(options, PingOptions()...)
    options = append(options, DocsOptions()...)
    options = append(options, MyCommandOptions()...) // Add your new command options

    return options
}
```

**Important**: Never use `viper.SetDefault()` directly in command files. Our `validate:defaults` task will catch any violations of this rule.

### Automatic Documentation Generation

Generate comprehensive configuration documentation with:

```bash
task generate:docs:config
```

This creates a Markdown file at `docs/configuration.md` with:

- All available configuration options
- Default values and types
- Environment variable names
- Full descriptions

For a configuration template, run:

```bash
task generate:config:template
```

### Configuration File

Default config file: `$HOME/.ckeletin-go.yaml` (or `myapp.yaml` if renamed).

Example:

```yaml
app:
  log_level: "debug"
  ping:
    output_message: "Hello World!"
    output_color: "green"
    ui: true
```

### Environment Variables

Override any config via environment variables with automatic prefix based on binary name:

```bash
# For binary name "ckeletin-go":
export CKELETIN_GO_APP_LOG_LEVEL="debug"
export CKELETIN_GO_APP_PING_OUTPUT_MESSAGE="Hello, World!"
export CKELETIN_GO_APP_PING_UI=true

# If you renamed to "myapp":
export MYAPP_APP_LOG_LEVEL="debug"
```

### Command-Line Flags

Override at runtime:

```bash
./myapp ping --message "Hi there!" --color yellow --ui
```

### Configuration Precedence

Configuration values are resolved in this order:

1. Command-line flags (highest priority)
2. Environment variables
3. Configuration file
4. Default values (lowest priority)

---

## Dependency Management

**ckeletin-go** includes robust dependency management tools to ensure your application remains secure and up-to-date:

### Available Tasks

- `task check:deps:verify`: Verifies that dependencies haven't been modified
- `task check:deps:outdated`: Checks for outdated dependencies
- `task check:deps`: Runs all dependency checks (verification, outdated, vulnerabilities)

### Automated Checks

Dependency verification is automatically included in:

- Pre-commit hooks via Lefthook (prevents commits with corrupted dependencies)
- CI workflow via GitHub Actions (as part of `task check`)
- The comprehensive quality check command: `task check`

### Best Practices

1. Run `task check:deps` before starting a new feature
2. Update dependencies incrementally with `go get -u <package>` followed by `task tidy`
3. Always run tests after dependency updates
4. Document significant dependency changes in commit messages

---

## Commands

### `ping` Command

A sample command showing how to use Cobra, Viper, Zerolog, and Bubble Tea together.

#### Usage

```bash
./myapp ping [flags]
```

#### Flags

- `--message`: Override output message.
- `--color`: Override output color.
- `--ui`: Enable Bubble Tea UI.

#### Examples

```bash
./myapp ping
./myapp ping --message "Hello!" --color cyan
./myapp ping --ui
```

---

## Development Workflow

### Taskfile Tasks

- `task setup`: Install tools.
- `task format`: Format code.
- `task lint`: Run linters.
- `task check:vuln`: Check for vulnerabilities.
- `task check:deps:verify`: Verify dependency integrity.
- `task check:deps:outdated`: Check for outdated dependencies.
- `task check:deps`: Run all dependency checks (verification, outdated, vulnerabilities).
- `task test`: Run tests with coverage.
- `task test:coverage:text`: Detailed coverage report.
- `task check`: All checks (format, lint, deps, tests).
- `task build`: Build the binary.
- `task run`: Run the binary.
- `task clean`: Clean artifacts.
- `task check:release`: Check if GoReleaser is installed.
- `task test:release`: Test release build locally (snapshot).
- `task build:release`: Build release artifacts without publishing.
- `task clean:release`: Clean GoReleaser artifacts.

### Pre-Commit Hooks with Lefthook

`task setup` installs hooks that run `format`, `lint`, `test` on commit, ensuring code quality before changes land in the repository.

### Continuous Integration

GitHub Actions runs `task check` on each commit or pull request, maintaining code standards and reliability.

### Creating Releases

This project uses [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/) for automated, professional releases.

#### Release Process

1. **Prepare the release**:
   ```bash
   # Ensure all changes are committed
   git status

   # Run quality checks
   task check

   # Update CHANGELOG.md with release notes
   vim CHANGELOG.md
   ```

2. **Create and push a semantic version tag**:
   ```bash
   # Create annotated tag (e.g., v1.0.0, v1.1.0, v1.0.1)
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"

   # Push the tag
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

3. **CI automatically**:
   - Validates the semantic version tag
   - Runs quality checks
   - Builds binaries for multiple platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
   - Generates checksums and SBOM
   - Creates GitHub release with changelog
   - Updates Homebrew tap

#### Local Release Testing

Test the release process locally before pushing a tag:

```bash
# Check if GoReleaser is installed
task check:release

# Build snapshot release (no tag required)
task test:release

# Test the generated binaries
./dist/ckeletin-go_linux_amd64_v1/ckeletin-go --version
```

#### Supported Platforms

- **Linux**: amd64, arm64
- **macOS**: amd64 (Intel), arm64 (Apple Silicon)
- **Windows**: amd64

#### Release Artifacts

Each release includes:
- Platform-specific binaries (archives: tar.gz, zip)
- `checksums.txt` for verification
- SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) in SPDX format
- Automated changelog from git commits

#### Enabling Homebrew Tap (Optional)

Homebrew tap is disabled by default. To enable it:

1. Create a `homebrew-tap` repository in your GitHub account
2. Add GitHub secrets to your repository:
   - `HOMEBREW_TAP_OWNER` - Your GitHub username
   - `HOMEBREW_TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN` - Token with repo access
3. Update CI workflow to pass the environment variable to GoReleaser

Once enabled, releases will automatically update your Homebrew tap.

For more details, see [ADR-008: Release Automation](docs/adr/008-release-automation-with-goreleaser.md).

---

## Customization

**In Short**:

- Change `BINARY_NAME` in `Taskfile.yml` to rename your CLI.
- Add commands using `cobra-cli`: `cobra-cli add hello`.
- Adjust configs in Viper.
- Enhance UI in `internal/ui/`.

### Changing the Program Name

In `Taskfile.yml`:

```yaml
vars:
  BINARY_NAME: myapp
```

Then:

```bash
task build
./myapp ping
```

### Adding New Commands

Add a new command following Cobra best practices: each command in its own file, cleanly separated and easily testable.

For faster development, copy and modify the template file:

```bash
cp cmd/template_command.go.example cmd/hello.go
```

Then edit the file to implement your command and its configuration options. Flags and help will be auto-generated from the options metadata.

You can also scaffold both files with Task:

```bash
task generate:command name=hello
```

### Command Implementation Pattern

The project uses an idiomatic Cobra/Viper pattern with command inheritance and self-registered configuration providers:

1. The root command's `PersistentPreRunE` initializes global configuration
2. Child commands inherit this behavior through Cobra's command chain
3. Command-specific configuration is declared in the command file (e.g., `cmd/<command>.go`) and self-registered via `config.RegisterOptionsProvider`
4. Flags and help text are auto-registered from the registry using `RegisterFlagsForPrefixWithOverrides(cmd, "app.<command>.", overrides)`

Benefits of this pattern:

- Reduces duplication across commands
- Ensures consistent configuration handling
- Maintains command independence
- Simplifies adding new commands

When implementing a new command:

1. In `cmd/<command>.go`, define `<Command>Options() []config.ConfigOption` and call `config.RegisterOptionsProvider(<Command>Options)` in `init()`
2. Still in `cmd/<command>.go`, call `RegisterFlagsForPrefixWithOverrides(cmd, "app.<command>.", overrides)` to create flags and bind them to Viper
3. Use `getConfigValueWithFlags[T](cmd, flagName, viperKey)` in your config constructor to honor flag precedence over config

### Options Pattern for Command Configuration

The project implements the Options Pattern for command configuration, with a single source of truth for defaults and docs in the options registry. Benefits:

1. **Testability**: Commands can be easily tested with different configurations
2. **Modularity**: Configuration is encapsulated in dedicated structs
3. **Type Safety**: Using strong typing and generics for configuration values
4. **Default Handling**: Consistent handling of default values from the registry
5. **Readability**: Clear separation of configuration from command logic

To implement the Options Pattern for a new command:

1. **Create a configuration struct**:

   ```go
   type CommandConfig struct {
     Option1 string
     Option2 bool
     // Add other options as needed
   }
   ```

2. **Define functional options**:

   ```go
   type CommandOption func(*CommandConfig)

   func WithOption1(value string) CommandOption {
     return func(cfg *CommandConfig) { cfg.Option1 = value }
   }

   func WithOption2(value bool) CommandOption {
     return func(cfg *CommandConfig) { cfg.Option2 = value }
   }
   ```

3. **Create a constructor**:

   ```go
   func NewCommandConfig(cmd *cobra.Command, opts ...CommandOption) CommandConfig {
     cfg := CommandConfig{
       Option1: getConfigValueWithFlags[string](cmd, "option1", "app.command.option1"),
       Option2: getConfigValueWithFlags[bool](cmd, "option2", "app.command.option2"),
     }
     for _, opt := range opts {
       opt(&cfg)
     }
     return cfg
   }
   ```

4. **Use the config in your command**:

   ```go
   func runCommand(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) error {
     cfg := NewCommandConfig(cmd)
     // Use cfg.Option1, cfg.Option2, etc.
     return nil
   }
   ```

See `cmd/ping.go` and `cmd/template_command.go.example` for working examples of this pattern.

### Modifying Configurations

Configuration options live alongside their commands and self-register with the global registry. To add or modify configurations:

1. **Add options**: In `cmd/<command>.go`, implement `<Command>Options() []config.ConfigOption` with keys like `app.<command>.<option>`.
2. **Self-register**: In `init()`, call `config.RegisterOptionsProvider(<Command>Options)`.
3. **Flags binding**: In the same command file, call `RegisterFlagsForPrefixWithOverrides(cmd, "app.<command>.", overrides)` instead of manual flag definitions and binds.
4. **Read values**: In your config constructor, use `getConfigValueWithFlags[T](cmd, flagName, viperKey)` so CLI flags override config/env.
5. **Docs**: Run `task generate:docs:config` to regenerate documentation.

Remember: **Never** use `viper.SetDefault()` directly. Defaults are applied via the registry in `cmd/root.go`.

### Whatâ€™s Framework vs. What You Should Edit

- Framework (avoid modifying unless you are changing the scaffold itself):
  - `cmd/root.go` (bootstrap, root wiring, `setupCommandConfig`, helpers like `getConfigValueWithFlags`/`getKeyValue`)
  - `cmd/flags.go` (auto-registration of flags from options)
  - `internal/config/options.go` (types), `internal/config/registry.go` (provider registry + `SetDefaults`)
  - `internal/logger/*`, `internal/ui/*`, `internal/docs/*` (shared subsystems)
  - `Taskfile.yml`, scripts under `scripts/`

- User-editable (where you implement your app):
  - New commands under `cmd/<command>.go`
  - Command options under `internal/config/<command>_options.go`
  - Documentation content under `docs/` as needed
  - Optional UI customizations under `internal/ui/*` for your app-specific UI

### Customizing the UI

Explore the `internal/ui/` package to modify the Bubble Tea model, colors, and interactivity. Use configs to allow runtime customization of UI elements.

### Cursor AI Integration

The project includes a template for Cursor AI rules in `dot.cursorrules`. This template contains detailed project specifications that help Cursor AI understand the project structure, coding conventions, and requirements.

To use it with Cursor:

1. Copy the template to a `.cursorrules` file:

```bash
cp dot.cursorrules .cursorrules
```

2. Cursor will automatically detect and use these rules to provide better code suggestions and assistance.

The template covers:

- Project structure and design principles
- Command implementation patterns
- Error handling guidelines
- Testing requirements
- Git commit conventions

You can customize the rules to match your project's specific requirements.

## Tooling Best Practices

**Cobra** ([repo](https://github.com/spf13/cobra), [docs](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/spf13/cobra)):

- Keep commands small and focused.
- Each command in its own file promotes clarity and testability.
- Use `RunE` to return errors gracefully rather than exiting immediately.

**Viper** ([repo](https://github.com/spf13/viper), [docs](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/spf13/viper)):

- Set defaults first, then allow overrides via config files, env vars, and flags.
- Keep configuration keys consistent and descriptive.
- Exploit environment variable binding and automatic environment detection for easy deployment in different environments.

**Zerolog** ([repo](https://github.com/rs/zerolog), [docs](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/rs/zerolog)):

- Use structured logs for better machine readability.
- Set a global log level and pass context around rather than using global variables directly.
- Keep logs concise and meaningful; leverage fields to add context without cluttering messages.

**Bubble Tea** ([repo](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea), [docs](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea)):

- Keep the TUI logic isolated in its package or command.
- Make colors, messages, and interactions configurable to adapt to user preferences.

By following these best practices, you ensure that your CLI remains maintainable, testable, and flexible enough to grow with your project's needs.
