# Changelog Requirements

## Format and Location
1. Location: CHANGELOG.md
2. Format: Keep a Changelog (<https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/>)

## Structure
The CHANGELOG must have the following structure:
- **[Unreleased]** section at top for upcoming changes
- Version sections with release dates (e.g., `## [1.0.0] - 2023-05-15`)
- Category headings within each version:
  - **Added**: New features
  - **Changed**: Changes to existing functionality
  - **Deprecated**: Soon-to-be removed features
  - **Removed**: Removed features
  - **Fixed**: Bug fixes
  - **Security**: Vulnerability fixes

## Required Actions
When making changes to the codebase:
1. Add all significant changes to the [Unreleased] section
2. Use end-user language, not technical details
3. Update comparison links at the bottom of the file
4. Include changelog updates in all PRs

## Example Format
```markdown
# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](mdc:https:/keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](mdc:https:/semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
