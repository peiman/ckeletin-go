# CLI Interface Principles

## Progressive Disclosure
- Basic usage must be simple and intuitive
- Advanced features should be available but not required for basic operations
- Implement optional flags for advanced functionality
- Provide sensible defaults for all options

## Default Values
- Every option must have a sensible default
- All defaults must be clearly documented in help text
- Default configuration should work without requiring additional setup
- Document all defaults in a centralized location

## Interface Consistency
- Command structure must be uniform across all commands
- Follow consistent flag naming patterns:
  - Use `--kebab-case` for all flags
  - Short flags should be single letters when possible
  - Use consistent naming patterns across related commands
  - Group related flags together in help output

## Error Handling
- Error messages must explain three things:
  - What went wrong
  - Why it went wrong
  - How to fix it
- Always return appropriate exit codes
  - 0 for success
  - Non-zero for errors, with specific codes for different error types
- Use color and formatting to highlight error messages when appropriate

## Documentation
- Every command must have comprehensive documentation:
  - Short description (one line)
  - Long description (multiple paragraphs as needed)
  - Example usage with common scenarios
  - Documentation for all flags and subcommands
- Include examples that show real-world usage patterns
- Document both simple and advanced use cases
