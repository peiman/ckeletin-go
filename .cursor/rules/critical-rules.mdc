# CRITICAL RULES - ALWAYS READ FIRST

This document lists critical rules that MUST be checked before performing specific actions.

## Before Performing Git Commits
⚠️ ALWAYS check the `before-git-commit` rule before suggesting or preparing any git commits
- The rule explains the exact commit message format required
- It provides instructions on how to present commit messages
- IT PROHIBITS RUNNING GIT COMMIT COMMANDS directly

## Before Making Code Changes
- Check `code-organization` to understand how code should be structured
- Check `go-standards` for Go-specific coding standards
- For CLI commands, check `cmd-pattern` before modifying command code
- For any config changes, check `cli-interface` for UI/UX principles

## Before Testing and Quality Checks
- Check `testing` for test structure and phase requirements
- Run `task check` before any commit to ensure quality
- Ensure 80% minimum coverage is maintained for all changes

## Before Documenting Changes
- Check `changelog` for proper changelog entry format
- Follow the Keep a Changelog format for all version entries
- Document all user-facing changes in the CHANGELOG.md file

This list is not exhaustive. Always refer to the specific rule files for complete guidance.
