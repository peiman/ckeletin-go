# Versioning and Release Standards

## Semantic Versioning
This project strictly follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](mdc:https:/semver.org):
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes
- **MINOR**: New features (backward-compatible)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes (backward-compatible)

## Version Format
- Git tags must use the `v` prefix: `v1.0.0`
- Version references in code and documentation should be consistent
- All version components are numeric only

## Release Process
The release process follows these steps:
1. Update CHANGELOG.md with all changes since the last release
2. Update all version references in code and documentation
3. Create a git tag with the `v` prefix (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
4. Push the tag to trigger the release workflow
5. Verify the release artifacts are correctly published

## Release Notes
All releases must include:
- A summary of changes from CHANGELOG.md
- Highlighted breaking changes (if any)
- Upgrade instructions (especially for MAJOR version changes)
- Links to relevant issues and pull requests

## Pre-Release Versions
For pre-release versions:
- Use the format: `v1.0.0-beta.1`
- Document clearly that these are not production-ready
- Include known limitations and issues

## Release Cadence
- PATCH releases: As needed for bug fixes
- MINOR releases: When new features are ready
- MAJOR releases: Scheduled with adequate notice for breaking changes

## Long-Term Support
- Clear communication about supported versions
- Security fixes for previous MAJOR versions when practical
- Documentation of support timelines
